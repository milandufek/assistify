## Installation

Clone repository and install the requirements.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:milandufek/assistify.git
cd assistify
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Add your API key to `openai_api_key` value in `config.json` or set global environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

If both set the environment variable takes precedence.

Ensure you have some money on your OpenAI account :).

```bash
python assistify.py
```

### Currency conversion
